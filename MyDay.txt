I wake up, get a aggresive godmorning from my dog
my cats will scream in the kitchen til i feed them
walk the dog in any weather, lovely
pretend to be cool and study my cool course
eat something, someone once told me that is important
walk time again probably maybe even go to the park. dont forget the ball tho
get screamed at again becouse dinner time
get back to bed
repeat the day after
