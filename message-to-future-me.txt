dear me (6 mothes from now)
we still alive?

did we get a grip about how to work projects?
i do realise right now it seems abit complicated but you got it right.

Right know we do fight abit with the whole thing but i belive
with some time and some work you will get a better understanding about it.
you will probabaly never look as cool as you want to but still
you will be cool enough, remeber that

remeber how confused you where staring out. you will understand alot more.
always remeber you started with almost nothing! 

keep it up
